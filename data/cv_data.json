  "profile": "Senior software engineer with more than seven years' hands-on experience designing, building and running web platforms. I pair clean TypeScript, PHP and Python with pragmatic tooling such as Docker, and I'm happiest when the uptime graph is flat and deployment logs are uneventful.\n\nAt Freelancer.com I look after reliability. The live dashboards I introduced trimmed roughly a third from our incident-response time, and the Docker / Jenkins pipeline I set up turned multi-hour releases into routine ten-minute jobs.\n\nDay-to-day I prune legacy code, improve developer experience by writing scripts that spare the team from repetitive work. The role is a permanent, in-house position at Freelancer.com's UK branch – I'm not a freelancer despite the name.",
